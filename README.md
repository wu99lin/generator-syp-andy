## Getting Started

**Note:** If you're planning to contribute refer to **Installation for devs** instead!

### Installation

As SypAndy is a Yeoman plugin, it's mandatory to install first Yeoman if you didn't do it before:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

Once the step before is finished, you can install SypAndy properly:

```
npm install -g generator-syp-andy
```

### Installation for Devs

As SypAndy is a Yeoman plugin, it's mandatory to install first Yeoman if you didn't do it before:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

Clone this repository and `cd` into it:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/wu99lin/generator-syp-andy.git && cd generator-syp-andy
```

Link it:

```
$ npm link
```

Now you can use `yo andy` as usual!
